This project focuses on developing a system that can recognize various food items from images and estimate their calorie content. By utilizing computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the system processes images to identify the type of food and then calculates the estimated calorie count based on the recognized item. This tool is designed to help users track their dietary intake more accurately, making it a valuable resource for health-conscious individuals and those managing specific nutritional goals.
